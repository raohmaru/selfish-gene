# SGE
A JavaScript game engine.

Currently it is written in [vanilla JavaScript](http://vanilla-js.com/) and only supports 
[HTML5 Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) as renderer.

## Getting Started
Just clone the repository and deep into the code.

The engine is in alpha status, which means that it may contain bugs, be unstable and the API may change without notice as a result of product updates.

## Examples
Open demo/selfish-gene/index.html in your favourite browser, or navigate to https://raohmaru.github.io/demo/selfish-gene/index.html.

## Browser Support
SGE supports IE 10+, Edge, Firefox 15+, Chrome 20+, Safari 8+.
In order to support older browsers, you need polyfills for the following JavaScript features:

- [Performance.now()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now)
- [window.requestAnimationFrame()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)
