# The Selfish Gene
A JavaScript game based on Richard Dawkins' book The Selfish Gene.

It doesn't use a framework nor a game engine, just [vanilla JavaScript](http://vanilla-js.com/) and
[HTML5 Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).

## Getting Started
Open src/index.html in your favourite browser, or navigate to https://raohmaru.github.io/selfish-gene/src/index.html.

## Know issues
There is no limit in the number of genes on the screen. If the browser's performance slows down (it
happens with thousands of genes), close the tab or pause JavaScript execution.
